Washington's personal website running on Gatsby, React, and Node.js.

## Note

I've made my website open source for your inspiration, motivation, and curiosity. However, this site is highly customized and personally tailored, and it is not simply a theme. **I encourage you to be creative and create your own theme, design, and content.**

The [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/) is a great place to start, and is the base for this blog.
